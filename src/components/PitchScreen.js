          <h2>Customers Want Low Prices</h2>
          <p>
            To get low prices 85% of the consumers check at least 2 data points
            (Source: BCG Consumer Trends). In various sectors information
            centred buying has been made more efficient by companies like MMT
            for Travel, Policy bazaar for Insurance, Myntra or Shopperstop for
            Lifestyle products. However for rental products, there is no one &
            to fill this need and make the process efficient we launched
            LetzRent, hoping to have a first-mover advantage and dominate the
            market in the coming future.

          <h2>Single KYC</h2>
          <p>
            Renting is a KYC dependent process, every time a customer books a
            service from a different service provider he/she will have to get a
            new KYC done. With Letzrent, the hassle of multiple KYC gets removed
            and with a single KYC, customers can rent from multiple brands.

          <h2>Why Renting?</h2>
          <ol type='1'>
            <li>
              Demographic Twist: Commitment phobic millennials prefer an asset
              lite life with a bias toward renting rather than buying.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flexibility: Renting allows people to upgrade or change assets
              easily.
            </li>
            <li>
              Convenience: With the rental customers dispense with the headache
              of down payment, maintenance, insurance etc.
            </li>
